# 📚 College Bookstore

> **Bridging the gap between seniors and juniors.**

**College Bookstore** is a web-based marketplace designed specifically for university students. It solves the common problem of expensive textbooks by allowing students to buy and sell second-hand books directly within the campus community.

## 💡 Why I Built This?
As a Computer Science student, I noticed that many juniors struggle to find affordable books, while seniors often have books piling up that they no longer need. I built this platform to create a sustainable, cost-effective solution that connects buyers and sellers efficiently.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **🔐 Secure Authentication:** Students can sign up and log in securely to manage their listings.
* **📸 Easy Listings:** Sellers can upload book details along with real images directly to the platform.
* **🔍 Smart Search:** Buyers can search for books by title, author, or semester.
* **📱 Responsive Design:** The interface is user-friendly and works across different devices.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
This project is built using the **MERN** ecosystem concepts (minus React for now) and follows the MVC architecture.

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates)
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
* **Database:** MongoDB
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
